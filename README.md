sustAIn is a machine learning program which I have created especially to help categorize the waste between organic and inorganic. I feel this is a very important issue since in our day to day life we might not be differentiating the waste. By doing so we can increase the amount of waste which is recycled and decrease the waste ending up in landfills. Therefore, making our environment a much cleaner place.
